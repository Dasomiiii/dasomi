Yesterday, I wrote this math equation for precisely (I think) calculating the length of a string of lights wrapped around a christmas tree â€“ assuming the tree is shaped like a perfect cone and that the lights are as tighly and evenly wrapped around the cone as possible.

Excuse the Swedish! The variables are described as followed:<br>
<ul>
    <li>H: the tree's height</li>
    <li>r: the tree's radius</li>
    <li>v: the amount of revolutions</li>
</ul>

This is hardly a feat in the math world, and my equations are probably quite bloated, but I'm still quite happy with it, alright? :)
